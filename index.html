          <h3>Why I took this class?</h3>
            <p> The reason why I took this class is with the goal to learn basics way on how computer works. As a world that is dependent on technology, I must obtain a little knowledge of the methods that we rely on in almost everyday. It is important to learn how we can command computers because we will be able to make it do what we expect and desire as its function. Having the control on your computer will enable you to obtain some knowledge or skills that could help yourself from becoming a victim of today's danger in technology use.</p>

        <h3> What are my expectation for this class? </h3> 
        <p> As I was hoping for it, I really want to have the knowledge to work out computers that is being used everyday. I believe that having control on tools that we use can prevent ourselves from becoming a victim by the danger that internet could bring. Not only that but I also expect from this class to learn basics method on developing things using codes such as softwares. Knowing how to do these things will give me the advantage of recognizing concepts on general computer use, starting from coding.</p>

         <h2>UX vs UI</h2>
         <h3>Difference between UX and UI</h3>
         <p>UX or User Experience Design is where more of analytical and technical field is done.</p>
         <p>UI or User Interface Design is more closer or involved with graphic design and is more complex.</p>

          <h2>Responsive and Mobile Design</h2>
          <p>So, Responsive and Mobile Design is probably one of the topics taught in this class that I had a better understanding on. I believe that responsive design is a technique to which it will allow a website to follow the size of a device that is using it. In other words, it makes the website or application to fit on the screen of this device (cellphone/ipad/computer). For my own evaluation on myself, I think I deserve a satisfying grade because of the effort that I invested on that assignment. I know that my finished assignment may not be the greatest of them all, but I take pride over it and that gives me the authorization to offer myself a good grade.</p>

          <h2>Digimongo</h2>
          <p>Digimingo was a fun project to do because I got the chance of formating different kinds of Digimon characters. This project was very helpful to me because it brightened my understanding in CSS. I was vey confused with the functions of CSS, but with the pressure this project is putting on my head, I had to force myself to learn it alone which I don't usually do in my other classes. At the end of the due date, I was able to complete all of the parts but unable to completely follow the exact expected result such as for some part with different color. Despite all the things that had happened in doing this project, I am grateful that I was able to learn from it and deserves the satisfying grade.</p>

          <h2>Media Queries</h2>
          <p>I think Media Queries is very similar to Responsive and Mobile Design which is involve in screen resolution. I think Media Queries was somehow not that very complicated. I think I adopted easily with the idea of adding breakpoints on web designs. I liked doing this assignment because it did not torture me of not being able to understand its meaning. I think I did good in completing the work.</p>

          <h2>Basic Javascript</h2>
          <p>Doing this assignment was very relieving for me because I felt like I was just inserting information in coding. What I ment by that is I liked inputting values on something. Just like the way how I like finding values of variables from math class which I find interesting and easy at the same time. The Basic Javascript was a good assignment because it cleared my understanding of how Javascript works and gave me a real experience by letting me do it literally.</p>

          <h2>Conditional Alliens</h2>
          <p>I have to be honest, doing the "Conditional Alliens" with a partner is fun because I get to experience the humor of others. Although it was most about enjoying, I think I understood what or how conditional statements can be converted into a code from a computer. I enjoyed this because it was flattering to invent crazy ideas about alliens invading Earth. As my partner said, "if alliens invade earth, then call the avengers." </p>

          <h2>Verizon App Challenge Review</h2>
          <p>The issue that my group had is the lack of an effective way of communication for school clubs, announcements and teachers to their students. It is an issue of which users have an unorganized and ineffective communication. The app that my team had created to solve this problem is called the "SchoolComm." It shall provide the users more efficient way of contacting people, accessing informations and allowing instructors to get in touch with their students. In regards to our video, it can be improved by including more information about the app, the problems it will solve and less of the interviews. This app features a separate conversation between club officers and members and instant sign ups without requiring any information but your e-mail or phone number. The features that I would like to add in our app is a calendar or a scheduling space so that users can work in just one app, our app. The most difficult that my team had to face was filming the videos. As you already know, none of us was great as an actor that can easily smile or do whatever we may tell ourselves to do. What I would strongly suggest to do differently next time is the action of constructing the idea of the app. I would like to use a method called the Design Thinking process to effectively and intelligently solve the problem that we are trying to come up of a solution with. </p>

          <h2>Semester Review</h2>
          <p>This semester has been a real challenge for myself. I try to remind myself of the reasons on taking the programing class instead of any easier ones, but all I can remember is that knowing how to code seemed to have many advantage. Instead of giving myself all the problems I had while trying to survive this class, I could have been sitting somewhere else getting "an easy A" but I am not. And there was a time that it suddenly hit me of the many good reasons why I took this class. The first is that being technologically involved provides you basic protection for yourself from the internet and know what is happening to a website after opening. The second reason is that having the knowledge to work codes give you a lot of opportunities because most jobs today will at least require an applicant how to operate a computer. Anyways, let's talk about my performances and so as my instructors'. Of course I did horrible in many of the assignment that was assigned to me, but I did all that I can to get the best result as possible. When it comes to the teachers, they are amazing. They show their passion of what they do and are willing to share all they know to help their students become the best coders that they can be. It was nice having this class because what it can do is very similar of what magic can do. This class taught me that I can manipulate computers of what they show on screens. It can do amazing stuff that it will only leave you so amazed and feel like a magical person. "Amazing...."</p>
