          <h3>Why I took this class?</h3>
            <p> The reason why I took this class is with the goal to learn basics way on how computer works. As a world that is dependent on technology, I must obtain a little knowledge of the methods that we rely on in almost everyday. It is important to learn how we can command computers because we will be able to make it do what we expect and desire as its function. Having the control on your computer will enable you to obtain some knowledge or skills that could help yourself from becoming a victim of today's danger in technology use.</p>

      <h3> What are my expectation for this class? </h3> 
      <p> As I was hoping for it, I really want to have the knowledge to work out computers that is being used everyday. I believe that having control on tools that we use can prevent ourselves from becoming a victim by the danger that internet could bring. Not only that but I also expect from this class to learn basics method on developing things using codes such as softwares. Knowing how to do these things will give me the advantage of recognizing concepts on general computer use, starting from coding.</p>
