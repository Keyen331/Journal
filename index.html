          <h3>Why I took this class?</h3>
            <p> The reason why I took this class is with the goal to learn basics way on how computer works. As a world that is dependent on technology, I must obtain a little knowledge of the methods that we rely on in almost everyday. It is important to learn how we can command computers because we will be able to make it do what we expect and desire as its function. Having the control on your computer will enable you to obtain some knowledge or skills that could help yourself from becoming a victim of today's danger in technology use.</p>

        <h3> What are my expectation for this class? </h3> 
        <p> As I was hoping for it, I really want to have the knowledge to work out computers that is being used everyday. I believe that having control on tools that we use can prevent ourselves from becoming a victim by the danger that internet could bring. Not only that but I also expect from this class to learn basics method on developing things using codes such as softwares. Knowing how to do these things will give me the advantage of recognizing concepts on general computer use, starting from coding.</p>

         <h2>UX vs UI</h2>
         <h3>Difference between UX and UI</h3>
         <p>UX or User Experience Design is where more of analytical and technical field is done.</p>
         <p>UI or User Interface Design is more closer or involved with graphic design and is more complex.</p>

          <h2>Responsive and Mobile Design</h2>
          <p>So, Responsive and Mobile Design is probably one of the topics taught in this class that I had a better understanding on. I believe that responsive design is a technique to which it will allow a website to follow the size of a device that is using it. In other words, it makes the website or application to fit on the screen of this device (cellphone/ipad/computer). For my own evaluation on myself, I think I deserve a satisfying grade because of the effort that I invested on that assignment. I know that my finished assignment may not be the greatest of them all, but I take pride over it and that gives me the authorization to offer myself a good grade.</p>

          <h2>Digimongo</h2>
          <p>Digimingo was a fun project to do because I got the chance of formating different kinds of Digimon characters. This project was very helpful to me because it brightened my understanding in CSS. I was vey confused with the functions of CSS, but with the pressure this project is putting on my head, I had to force myself to learn it alone which I don't usually do in my other classes. At the end of the due date, I was able to complete all of the parts but unable to completely follow the exact expected result such as for some part with different color. Despite all the things that had happened in doing this project, I am grateful that I was able to learn from it and deserves the satisfying grade.</p>

          <h2>Media Queries</h2>
          <p>I think Media Queries is very similar to Responsive and Mobile Design which is involve in screen resolution. I think Media Queries was somehow not that very complicated. I think I adopted easily with the idea of adding breakpoints on web designs. I liked doing this assignment because it did not torture me of not being able to understand its meaning. I think I did good in completing the work.</p>

          <h2>Basic Javascript</h2>
          <p>Doing this assignment was very relieving for me because I felt like I was just inserting information in coding. What I ment by that is I liked inputting values on something. Just like the way how I like finding values of variables from math class which I find interesting and easy at the same time. The Basic Javascript was a good assignment because it cleared my understanding of how Javascript works and gave me a real experience by letting me do it literally.</p>

          <h2>Conditional Alliens</h2>
          <p>I have to be honest, doing the "Conditional Alliens" with a partner is fun because I get to experience the humor of others. Although it was most about enjoying, I think I understood what or how conditional statements can be converted into a code from a computer. I enjoyed this because it was flattering to invent crazy ideas about alliens invading Earth. As my partner said, "if alliens invade earth, then call the avengers." </p>
